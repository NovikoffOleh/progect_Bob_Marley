        <p>"Stop that train"
            Stop that train: I'm leavin' - today!
        Stop that train: I'm leavin' - anyway!
        Stop that train: I'm leavin'. And I said:
        It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong;
        I said, it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong.
        
        All my good life I've been a lonely man,
        Teachin' my people who don't understand;
        And even though I tried my best,
        I still can't find no happiness.
        
        So I got to say:
        Stop that train: I'm leavin' - oh, baby now!
        Stop that train: I'm leavin' - don't care what you say!
        Stop that train: I'm leavin'. And I said:
        It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong;
        Said, it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong.
        
        Some goin' east; and-a some goin' west,
        Some stand aside to try their best.
        Some livin' big, but the most is livin' small::
        They just can't even find no food at all.
        
        I mean, stop it:
        Stop that train: I'm leavin' - leavin', mm-hmm.
        Stop that train: I'm leavin' - I don't mind!
        Stop that train: I'm leavin'. And I said:
        It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong;
        I said it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong.
        
        Stop that train: I'm leavin' - leavin'!
        Stop that train: I'm leavin' - can't take it!
        Stop that train: I'm leavin' - got to be better!
        It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong;
        I said it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong.</p>
        <p>"Zimbabwe"
        Every man gottaright to decide his own destiny,
        And in this judgement there is no partiality.
        So arm in arms, with arms, we'll fight this little struggle,
        'Cause that's the only way we can overcome our little trouble.
        
        Brother, you're right, you're right,
        You're right, you're right, you're so right!
        We gon' fight (we gon' fight), we'll have to fight (we gon' fight),
        We gonna fight (we gon' fight), fight for our rights!
        
        Natty Dread it in-a (Zimbabwe);
        Set it up in (Zimbabwe);
        Mash it up-a in-a Zimbabwe (Zimbabwe);
        Africans a-liberate (Zimbabwe), yeah.
        
        No more internal power struggle;
        We come together to overcome the little trouble.
        Soon we'll find out who is the real revolutionary,
        'Cause I don't want my people to be contrary.
        
        And, brother, you're right, you're right,
        You're right, you're right, you're so right!
        We'll 'ave to fight (we gon' fight), we gonna fight (we gon'fight)

        We gon' fight (we gon' fight), we'll 'ave to fight (we gon' fight),
        We gonna fight (we gon' fight), fighting for our rights!
        
        To divide and rule could only tear us apart;
        In everyman chest, mm - there beats a heart.
        So soon we'll find out who is the real revolutionaries;
        And I don't want my people to be tricked by mercenaries.
        
        Brother, you're right, you're right,
        You're right, you're right, you're so right!
        We'll 'ave to fight (we gon' fight), we gonna fight (we gon'fight),
        We'll 'ave to fight (we gon' fight), fighting for our rights!
